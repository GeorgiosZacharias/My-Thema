📦 My-Thema – Car Spare Parts E-Commerce Website

This project is a WordPress-based e-commerce website that I developed as part of my thesis. The website represents a car spare parts warehouse, allowing users to browse products and purchase them online through a complete e-shop flow.

🚗 What the Website Does

The website functions as an online store for car spare parts. I designed it to provide:

A product catalog where users can browse available spare parts

Individual product pages with detailed descriptions and pricing

A shopping cart system for adding and managing products

An online checkout process to complete purchases

Media content and structured pages to simulate a realistic warehouse/store experience

All e-commerce functionality is enabled through WordPress themes and plugins, which I configured and customized myself.

🛠️ Development & Setup

I built the website using WordPress and developed it locally with LocalWP

I configured themes and plugins to support full e-commerce functionality

I handled content creation, product setup, and overall site structure

I deployed the project using free hosting (InfinityFree), making the store publicly accessible

🎓 Project Purpose

I created this project as part of my academic thesis, and it demonstrates my ability to:

Build and configure a complete WordPress e-commerce website

Manage hosting, deployment, and site administration

Design and implement a functional online store based on a real-world business scenario
